    <h2>&ldquo;Men Are Messy&rdquo; (Season 1, Episode 8)</h2>

    <p>In this classic episode, it's men vs. women in the battle of housekeeping,
    and the Ricardos&rsquo; apartment gets divided in two. When Fred visits Ricky on
    &ldquo;his side,&rdquo; Ricky offers him some leftover chicken, but the catch is,
    the kitchen is on Lucy's side of the apartment!</p>

    <p>Inspired by Ricky's willingness to feed his pal, this classic Cuban chicken dish
    is marinated and roasted, and just as delicious no matter which side of the apartment
    it&rsquo;s served on.</p>

    <p><strong>Makes 8 servings</strong></p>
