    <h2>Chocolate Dream</h2>

    <p>These chocolate truffles are inspired by the <em>I Love Lucy</em> episode: <em>Job Switching</em>. After Ricky and Fred get upset about the girls&rsquo; spending, Lucy and Ethel go to 
    work in a candy factory while the boys do the housework. The classic recipe of the homemade 
    chocolate truffle includes a ganache which is a mixture of bittersweet chocolate and heavy cream.</p>

    <p><strong>Makes about 1 ½ cups ganache, or 24 truffles</strong></p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>⅞ cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>8 ounces good quality bittersweet chocolate, chopped</li>
        <li>Unsweetened cocoa powder as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat cream in a pot until it steams. Put chocolate in a bowl, pour hot cream on top, and stir
         until chocolate is melted and incorporated into cream.</li>
        <li>Chill until solid all the way through, 1 to 2 hours. Using a chilled melon baller or latex 
        gloves to prevent the ganache from melting or sticking to your hands, scoop out about a tablespoonful
        and quickly roll it into a ball. Repeat, lining truffles on a plate or a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>If truffles become too soft to handle, place them in refrigerator or freezer for a few minutes. 
        Roll them in cocoa powder, confectioners&rsquo; sugar, or a mixture of sugar and ground cinnamon. 
        Serve immediately or store, wrapped in plastic, in refrigerator for up to four days.</li>
    </ol>
